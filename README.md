# Game Project
A repository for my game code project. The purpose of this game is to act as a testbed, a way for me to quickly apply new coding concepts as I learn them. This game is a turn-based text-based RPG, inspired by sci fi classics like XCOM.

Currently the game is in v1.4. The next version promises to be big, with a new end-of-round item shop as well as a complete refactor!
